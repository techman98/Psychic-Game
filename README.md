# Psychic-Game

This project is a game that chooses a random letter from the alphabet and has the user guess which letter it is.

This project is useful because it demonstrates my ability to code with JavaScript using arrays, variables,
if's, if-elses's, and else's. It also demonstrates my ability to manipulate the DOM and create functions.
